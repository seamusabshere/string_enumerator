=string_enumerator

You provide a list of replacements ("replace [color] with red and blue") and then call the <tt>#enumerate</tt> method on a <tt>String</tt>:

    ?> u = StringEnumerator.new(:color => [ 'red', 'blue' ])
    => #<StringEnumerator...>
    ?> u.enumerate 'http://example.com/[color]'
    => [ 'http://example.com/blue', 'http://example.com/red' ]

The start and end of placeholders are marked with "[" and "]" (although you can override this if you want, see the tests.)

==Multiple placeholders per string

You can define as many replacements as you want, which will exponentially increase the final number of enumerations

    ?> u2 = StringEnumerator.new(:color => [ 'red', 'blue' ], :taste => [ 'savory', 'sweet' ])
    => #<StringEnumerator...>
    ?> u2.enumerate 'http://example.com/[color]/[taste]'
    => [ 'http://example.com/blue/savory', 'http://example.com/blue/sweet', 'http://example.com/red/savory', 'http://example.com/red/sweet' ]
